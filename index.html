        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Birthday: 2002/6/5</p>
        <p>Gender: Male</p>
        <p>Interest: Music, Basketball, Workout</p>
        <p>
                My name is Chiayang Lu, a master's student in Information Management at National Taipei University, with a bachelor's degree in Leisure and Sport Management and a minor in Economics. During my studies, I actively participated in various activities, organized and participated in large-scale events such as the NTU Paper Airplane Run, and held important positions in these events.
            I have excellent leadership and team management skills, value integrity, commitment, and transparent communication, and possess innovative thinking and cross-disciplinary learning abilities. During my internship at MyData Corporation, I gained extensive corporate internship experience, further enhancing my professional skills and practical abilities.
            My professional skills include AWS SAA and AWS CCP certifications, and I have a TOEIC score of 925. Additionally, I have obtained Python Coursera certification and have experience using GCP and MySQL, allowing me to flexibly apply these technologies to solve real-world problems.
            During my time at school, I actively participated in and led various on-campus and off-campus activities, developing excellent budget management and strategic thinking abilities, and demonstrating outstanding organizational and team collaboration skills in multiple activities. I believe that integrity and transparent communication are the cornerstones of building trust and promoting cooperation, so I always value these principles to create a good working and cooperative environment.
            In the future, I hope to continue to delve into the field of information management and related areas, combining the knowledge learned with practical experience to create greater value for enterprises and continuously enhance my professional skills and overall quality.
